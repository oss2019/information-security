**Information Security** is an umbrella term that incorporates dozens of niches within the industry. In security we can, for example, talk about digital forensics, or malware/ software detecting, auditing, pentesting, social engineering, and many other tracks. Each of these sub-categories within cybersecurity deserves a separate blog post, but, for the purposes of this piece, let’s focus on some important generic requirements that everyone needs before embarking on a successful career in IT Security.

### I have no experience with regards to cybersecurity, where do I start?

Teach yourself some absolute fundamentals such as TCP/ IP, programming, coding, markup and get your head around hacking tools and learn how to use them effectively.

Metasploit, Nmap and Burp Suite are three great examples of platforms that can be used to perform security testing of web applications and network vulnerabilities. Understanding why there is a vulnerability will catapult your knowledge, confidence and your skills in being able to detect (exploit) and patch (remediate) breaches and other ‘common’ security problems.

### Where can I learn? Here are a bunch of resources to get you going :)

- [Infosec Reference](https://github.com/rmusser01/Infosec_Reference)
- [Awesome Security](https://github.com/sbilly/awesome-security)
- [MIT OpenCourseWare](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/electrical-engineering-and-computer-science/6-858-computer-systems-security-fall-2014/index.htm)
- [OWASP Top 10](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Category:OWASP_Top_Ten_Project)

### Where can I practice my self-taught skills?

Once you’ve taught yourself hacking skills then go ahead and test them (legally) on purposely made Vulnerable Platforms. The aim of these platforms that are purposely vulnerable is that they allow novices and those with limited cyber experience to sharpen their penetration testing skills.

Example of an awesome vulnerable application is [OWASP Juice Shop](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_Juice_Shop_Project).

To get started clone the project from [Juice Shop Github Repo](https://github.com/bkimminich/juice-shop) and start hacking.

### Contributions

Your contributions are always welcome!

Contribution Best Practices:
- Write clear meaningful git commit messages.
- Make sure your PR's description contains GitHub's special keyword references that automatically close the related issue when the PR is merged.
- When you make very minor changes to a PR of yours make sure you squash your commits afterward so that you don't have an absurd number of commits for a very small fix.
